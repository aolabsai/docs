Though our core code is not public, we've made it accessible through a REST API as defined in this reference/ We're working on releasing our python bindings soon.

We'll help you build applications using our API and Agents; [connect directly our team](https://calendly.com/aee/meeting) .

[You'll need an API key, which you can get from us on discord](https://discord.gg/nHuJc4Y4n7).
