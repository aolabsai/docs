A Kennel is a collection object used to keep track of Agents in our API and associated cloud (AWS) backend; Agents are child to a Kennel.

Kennels are initialized with with an Arch, which you provide through a raw Github link, like this [example for our Basic Clam Agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aolabsai/archs/main/0_basic_clam.py) for the `arch_URL` parameter.

> 
> You can find 2 more Archs to fork and modify to suit your application in our [open Archs repo](https://github.com/aolabsai/archs).//

What goes into an Arch and how do you create one? [Read our Archs guide](https://docs.aolabs.ai/docs/arch).
