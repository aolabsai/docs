Given an INPUT, this method advances the agent to the next state; this means firing all neurons (constituting a state) and incrementing `agent.state` by 1.

And, optionally, in order of the arguments--

* **to train with labelled data** (ie. with a clean input\<>output pair), provide the output as LABEL; the agent's output neurons will match the LABEL and the agent will record the INPUT\<>LABEL as a positive learning event.

* **to train more autonomously**, without specifying labelled data, set INSTINCTS as `True`; when an agent's INPUT triggers any instinct conditions, the agent will record INPUT and its previous output as a learning event.

* **to force train positively** (i.e. train without a label or instinct), set Cpos as `True`; the agent will record INPUT and its previous output as a positive learning event

* **to force train negatively (do opposite)** (i.e. train without a label or instinct), set Cneg as `True`; the agent will record INPUT and its previous output as a negative learning event

* Finally, the result (of the output neurons only) can be printed in the console if `print_result=True.` 

The net result of `.next_state()` operations is stored in agent attributes `.story` and `.metastory`.

# Parameters

* **INPUT :*binary list or np.array of size matching agent.arch.I\_\_flat***\
          The input in binary to agent for one state.

* **LABEL :*binary string of size matching agent.arch.Z\_\_flat, optional***\
           Used to train the agent with the INPUT\<>LABEL pair provided; the output neurons will match the provided LABEL, too.

* **INSTINCTS :*bool, optional***\
           True value activates instinct neurons, so that training will automatically occur when INPUT matches the conditions of any instinct neurons as specified in `agent.arch`.

* **Cpos :*bool, optional***\
           True value force trains that agent with INPUT\<>previous\_output.

* **Cneg :*bool, optional***\
           True value force trains that agent with the inverse of INPUT\<>previous\_output.

* **print*result : \_bool, optional***\
           True value prints out the response of the output neurons to the console.

* **\{DD ; Hamming ; Default} :*bool, optional***\
           True value(s) activate different neuron-level firing rules; neurons can fire according to 3 rules: a weighted approximation (DD), a weightless method using Hamming distance, and random by default.

> ðŸš§ Neuron-level setting

> Keep them all as `True` is sufficient for most applications.
