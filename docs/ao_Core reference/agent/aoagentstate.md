A numpy array (integer data type) that stores the entire history of an agent in binary.

The shape is states by neurons; the rows of the array represent states and the number of columns is set by the total number of neurons of the agent.

# Example

```python
>>> agent.story.shape
[100000, 9]      # using our basic clam as the example

>>> agent.story[11, 2]
[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]     # displays the 12th state of the 3rd neuron
```

> ðŸ“˜ The number of rows is preallocated to `100000` and is populated in descending chronological order (so the oldest state is indexed first).
