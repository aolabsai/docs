**agent vs. model**

**state vs. step**

**association vs. mapping**

**instances vs. object**  
calling them subjects or individuals is a stretch, but the data structures we're working through aren't really objects. Axiomatic to object oriented programming is the sanctity of objectivity, and in many ways we are building AIs that has its own subjectivity. To make sharp this distinction, we will use instances more than objects to refer to components of ao_core.
