We welcome your feedback at v0.1.2 of our API and code.

Before your endeavor to build an Agent custom to your application, run through this guide to get familiar with our system, and please let us know if you make it through by pinging us on discord!

<br />

# Step 1) Pick a reference design to use as a template

We have 3 Agents to start you off, each configured with an Arch relative to its application.

<Table align={["left","left","left","left"]}>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ textAlign: "left" }}></th>
      <th style={{ textAlign: "left" }}></th>
      <th style={{ textAlign: "left" }}></th>
      <th style={{ textAlign: "left" }}></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
        [Basic Clam](https://aolabs.streamlit.app/)
      </td>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
        [App Code](https://github.com/aolabsai/archs/blob/main/Applications/HelloWorld-BasicClam/Clam_App.py)
      </td>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
        [Arch](https://github.com/aolabsai/archs/blob/main/0_basic_clam.py)
      </td>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
        a simple Agent that can associate A or B with output without labels
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
        [NetBox Device Discovery](https://aolabs-netbox.streamlit.app/)
      </td>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
        [App Code](https://github.com/aolabsai/archs/blob/application/Netbox_devicediscovery/Applications/Netbox/Device_Discovery/Main_Page.py)
      </td>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
        [Arch](https://github.com/aolabsai/archs/blob/main/2_netbox-device_discovery.py)
      </td>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
        a scaled up version of the Basic Clam that learns to predict a network device's role from its manufacture, type, and site; learns with labels
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
        MNIST Benchmark
      </td>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
        Coming Soon
      </td>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
        [Arch](https://github.com/aolabsai/archs/blob/main/1_basic_MNIST.py)
      </td>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
        *streamlit application coming soon*; a single-channel Agent trained on input-output image-label pairs to identify 0-9 from the handwritten numbers of the [MNIST database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database).
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

# Step 2) Fork an Arch and modify it to suit your application

Modify the Arch script to suit your application needs. This involves changing the number of input, output, and control neurons to match your data model. The Arch script is also where you define custom triggers for learning through instinct control neurons.

Here's a tutorial to walk you through the steps:

<TutorialTile backgroundColor="#8701f4" emoji="üõ†Ô∏è" id="6621d1feed483b0069f5872a" link="https://docs.aolabs.ai/v0.1.2/recipes/create-a-custom-arch" slug="create-a-custom-arch" title="Create a custom Arch" />

Designing your own Arch is something we're especially happy to help with! [Chat on discord](https://discord.gg/Zg9bHPYss5) or book a [meeting](https://calendly.com/aee/meeting).

<br />

# Step 3) Upload your Arch to our API with the [create Kennel](ref:kennelcreate) call

Host your Arch in a GitHub repo or on [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/)-- you'll use the [raw GitHub URL *like this*](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mi3law/b5ad6970630ed6f0f5dc7e5410651389/raw/aa66a5fb690afbe08b205ad7a64349a2b7539d0c/2_netbox-device_discovery.py) of your Arch to upload to our API.

You're also welcome to fork and pull request our [Archs repo](https://github.com/aolabsai/archs) so we can review your custom Arch.

> üìò If you don't have an API key, [request one on discord](https://discord.gg/nHuJc4Y4n7).

<br />

# Step 4) Then use [Agent invoke](ref:agentinvoke) to dynamically create and use Agents

Agents are created dynamically as you call them (in other words, if you invoke an Agent that doesn't exist yet, it'll be created). Build as many Agents as you need, per-user or otherwise. Agents maintain their own persistent memory.

<br />

> üëç You're ready to add Agents to your application!

# Now, what will you build?

Here are some high-level sketches of applications we're exploring as within scope of v0.1.2.
