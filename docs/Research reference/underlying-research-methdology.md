Professor [Piet Hut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Hut) is our main role model from whom we have established our conceptual framework in current academic language, hence the summary below.

Piet Hut is truly a being of great understanding. Here’s his wiki page, and his [professional profile](https://www.ias.edu/ids/piet) on IAS, where he is a program head. But really over the last few years, he’s delved into the science of the subject, as he puts it; the science of knowing about knowing, as he’s said at other times.

Here are the 2 main materials (both youtube clips) that are the best starting point–

[Clip starts at 47:02– Piet Hut on how to get started with the science of the subject](https://youtu.be/vhCqTbqCqx0?t=2822) - the whole talk is very stimulating but best to start from the clip.

[Clip at 45:12– Piet looking beyond Rene Descartes as the brilliant scientist he is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWhqZApm2qA\&t=2712s), in a way that unifies Eastern thought of awareness and experience with science.

As mentioned, Piet Hut has transitioned to more “esoteric” areas of research. He has since paused that work, too, in 2018, to consolidate his findings in a book on these topics. He explains that in this [blogpost](https://www.yhousenyc.org/yhouse-blog/all-posts/2018-4-23/science-cognition-and-contemplation-a-book-project). For these reasons after short correspondence we were unable to engage him as an academic advisor and remain on the search for a suitable candidate.
